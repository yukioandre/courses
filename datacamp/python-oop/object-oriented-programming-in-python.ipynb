    "#### OOP termininology\n",
    "That was a lot of terminology at once -- classes, objects, methods, attributes… Before you start writing your own object-oriented code, make sure you have a solid grasp on the main concepts of OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classify the cards into the correct buckets. Are the statements true or false?\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods encode behavior of an object and are represented by functions. TRUE\n",
    "\n",
    "Object is an abstract template describing the general states and behaviors. FALSE (this is the definition of class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object and class are different terms describing the same concept. FALSE\n",
    "\n",
    ".columns is an example of a method of a DataFrame object. FALSE\n",
    "\n",
    "A programming language can be either object-oriented or procedural, but not both. FALSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes encode the state of an object and are represented by variables. TRUE\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a software design practice of bundling the data and the methods that operates on that data. TRUE\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job! Classes and objects both have attributes and methods, but the difference is that a class is an abstract template, while an object is a concrete representation of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploring object interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn how to write object-oriented code is to study the design of existing classes. You've already learned about exploration tools like type() and dir().\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important function is help(): calling help(x) in the console will show the documentation for the object or class x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most real world classes have many methods and attributes, and it is easy to get lost, so in this exercise, you will start with something simpler. We have defined a class, and created an object of that class called mystery. Explore the object in the console using the tools that you learned.\n",

    "( ) It doesn't have a class\n",

    "\n",
    "Natasha -- our mystery employee -- has their salary stored in the attribute .salary.\n",

Notice how descriptive names of attributes and methods, together with the methods' docstrings, helped you figure out class functionality even when you didn't know how it was implemented. Keep this in mind when writing your own classes!"

    "\n",
